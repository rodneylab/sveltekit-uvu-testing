## Building and previewing the site

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodneylab/sveltekit-uvu-testing.git
cd sveltekit-uvu-testing
pnpm install # or npm install
pnpm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
pnpm run build
```

> You can preview the built app with `pnpm run preview`, regardless of whether you installed an adapter. This should _not_ be used to serve your app in production.
